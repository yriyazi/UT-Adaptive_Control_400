## Offline Identification of the System (Least Square Method)

In this simulation, the least square method is employed to identify the parameters of a system offline. The data collected from experiments or simulations is used to find the best-fit parameters that describe the system's dynamics. The code provided demonstrates how to perform offline system identification using the least square method.

## Online Identification of the System (Recursive Least Square Method)

The recursive least square method is utilized in this simulation to identify the system's parameters online. The system parameters are continuously updated as new data becomes available. The provided code illustrates the process of online system identification using the recursive least square method.

## Feedback Effects Analysis

This simulation delves into the analysis of feedback effects in an adaptive control scenario. Feedback loops can significantly impact the stability and performance of a control system. The code in this section demonstrates how to analyze and quantify the effects of feedback in the context of adaptive control.

## Kalman Identification

The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a dynamic system in the presence of noise and uncertainty. In this simulation, the Kalman filter is used for system identification, where it combines measurements and predictions to estimate the underlying system state. The included code showcases the implementation of Kalman identification for adaptive control.

## Nonlinear System Identification

Many real-world systems exhibit nonlinear behavior. This simulation focuses on identifying the parameters of a nonlinear system. Nonlinear system identification is crucial for accurately modeling and controlling complex systems. The code provided demonstrates techniques to identify the parameters of a nonlinear system in an adaptive control context.
