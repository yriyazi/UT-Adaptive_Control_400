## MIT Method for Fluid Level Control

This simulation scenario focuses on implementing the MIT (Mean-Integral-Time) control method for fluid level control. The MIT method aims to control the fluid level in a system by adjusting control signals based on the mean, integral, and time information of the process variable. The code provided demonstrates how to apply the MIT method to maintain desired fluid levels.

## Normalized MIT Method for Fluid Level Control

The Normalized MIT method is an enhanced version of the MIT method that incorporates normalization factors to improve control performance and adaptability. In this simulation, we explore the implementation of the Normalized MIT method for fluid level control. The included code showcases how to design and utilize the Normalized MIT method to achieve accurate and robust fluid level control.

## Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) for Fluid Level Control

The Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) is an adaptive control technique used to estimate system parameters and adjust control signals in real-time. This simulation scenario delves into the principles and application of MRAS for fluid level control. The provided code demonstrates how to implement the MRAS method to accurately control fluid levels even in the presence of uncertainties.
