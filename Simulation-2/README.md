## Pole Placement Dynamic Feedback

This simulation focuses on the pole placement technique for dynamic feedback control. Pole placement aims to place the closed-loop system poles at desired locations to achieve specific performance and stability objectives. The code provided demonstrates how to implement pole placement dynamic feedback control in an adaptive control setting.

## Self-Tuning Regulators (STR) for Minimum Phase Systems

Self-Tuning Regulators (STR) are adaptive control algorithms that adjust control parameters in real-time to optimize control performance. This simulation scenario focuses on STR applied to minimum phase systems, where the control goal is to achieve optimal performance while minimizing overshoot and settling time. The code showcases how to implement STR for minimum phase systems.

## Self-Tuning Regulators (STR) for Un-minimum Phase Systems

Un-minimum phase systems present unique challenges due to their inherent instability and phase characteristics. This simulation explores the application of Self-Tuning Regulators (STR) to un-minimum phase systems. The provided code demonstrates how to design and implement adaptive control strategies for stabilizing un-minimum phase systems.

## Self-Tuning Regulators (STR) for Continuous Systems

Continuous systems, characterized by continuous-time dynamics, require specialized control strategies. This simulation scenario covers the application of Self-Tuning Regulators (STR) to continuous systems. The code showcases how to adapt STR algorithms for continuous systems, ensuring stable and effective control performance.
