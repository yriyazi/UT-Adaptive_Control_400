# Simulation3: Advanced Controllers for Adaptive Control

Welcome to the Simulation3 folder! This repository contains code and resources for exploring advanced control strategies in an adaptive control context. The simulation scenarios included in this folder are:

1. Self-Tuning Regulators (STR)
2. Minimum Variance Controller (MV)
3. Moving Average Controller (MA)

## Self-Tuning Regulators (STR)

Self-Tuning Regulators (STR) are adaptive control algorithms that adjust control parameters in real-time to optimize control performance. In this simulation, we delve into the principles and implementation of STR. The provided code demonstrates how to apply STR in an adaptive control scenario to achieve accurate and robust control performance.

## Minimum Variance Controller (MV)

The Minimum Variance Controller (MV) is a control strategy aimed at minimizing the variance between the desired output and the actual system output. This simulation scenario explores the concepts and application of the MV controller in an adaptive control setting. The included code showcases how to design and implement the MV controller for achieving minimum variance control.

## Moving Average Controller (MA)

The Moving Average Controller (MA) is a simple yet effective control strategy that computes control signals based on the moving average of past error values. In this simulation, we explore the application of the MA controller in an adaptive control context. The code provided demonstrates how to implement the MA controller and utilize it to stabilize and control a system.
