# Adaptive Control Simulation

This repository contains simulation code and resources for Adaptive Control simulations, specifically focusing on five different simulation scenarios (Simulation 1 to 5). Adaptive control is a branch of control theory that enables a system to adjust its control parameters based on real-time observations, allowing the system to adapt to changing conditions and uncertainties.

## Introduction

Adaptive control plays a crucial role in controlling systems that exhibit uncertainties, disturbances, and varying dynamics. This repository aims to provide simulation implementations of different scenarios where adaptive control strategies can be applied to achieve robust and optimal control performance.

## Simulations

### Simulation 1

_Description:_ In this simulation, we consider a simple inverted pendulum system. The adaptive control algorithm is applied to stabilize the pendulum in the upright position while accounting for varying pendulum lengths.

### Simulation 2

_Description:_ Simulation 2 involves a quadcopter drone model subjected to wind gusts and payload changes. The adaptive control system adjusts the drone's control parameters to maintain stable flight in the presence of disturbances.

### Simulation 3

_Description:_ This simulation focuses on a robotic arm with varying payload weights. The adaptive control strategy is employed to ensure accurate and smooth control of the robotic arm's end-effector position despite changing load conditions.

### Simulation 4

_Description:_ In Simulation 4, we explore a temperature control system for a chemical reactor. The adaptive control algorithm adapts to uncertain heat exchange coefficients and disturbances to maintain the reactor's temperature at a desired setpoint.

### Simulation 5

_Description:_ Simulation 5 involves an autonomous vehicle navigating through a dynamic urban environment. The adaptive control system adjusts the vehicle's trajectory to account for sudden obstacles and changes in traffic patterns.
