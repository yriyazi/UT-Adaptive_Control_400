# Simulation4: Advanced Control Strategies for Challenging Systems

Welcome to the Simulation4 folder! This repository contains code and resources for exploring advanced control strategies in challenging control scenarios. The simulation scenarios included in this folder are:

1. Pole Placement Controller for Delayed System
2. Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with a Fixed Structure
3. Adaptive Model Predictive Controller

## Pole Placement Controller for Delayed System

This simulation scenario focuses on designing a pole placement controller for a system with delays. Delayed systems can introduce instability and performance issues in control. The code provided demonstrates how to apply pole placement techniques to design a controller that can handle delays effectively, maintaining stability and desired performance.

## Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with a Fixed Structure

The Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is an advanced control strategy that optimizes control signals over a future prediction horizon while considering system constraints. In this simulation, we explore the design and implementation of an MPC with a fixed structure. The included code showcases how to set up and utilize an MPC controller for controlling complex systems.

## Adaptive Model Predictive Controller

Adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an extension of MPC that allows the controller to adapt to changing system dynamics and uncertainties. This simulation scenario delves into the principles and application of Adaptive MPC. The provided code demonstrates how to implement an Adaptive MPC controller that adjusts its predictions and control actions based on real-time observations.
